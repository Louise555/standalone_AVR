# standalone_AVR
Few sketches commented/slighly changed from MAKE: AVR programming by Elliot Williams 
to be used with a standalone atmega328. See the document lab_standalone for the set ups and explanations of codes.
We use an arduino uno  as a programmer  to upload the sketches into the uC atmega328 (without bootloader) with the SPI bus.
serial communication is done with a USB UART converter: FTDI friends from adafruit.
