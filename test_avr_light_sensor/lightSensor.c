/* Quick Demo of light sensor
* The voltage is divided. Vcc - LDR - 33K - Gnd/ The analog pin is connected between the LDR and the resistor. The pin is PC0 (A0 of arduino)
*select a prescaler of 128 because tiy use the frequency of 16Mhz.
* you  can add a 0.1F capacitor between Aref and gnd for decoupling.
* You can catch the serial data with a python program and the library pyserial. see  python.reading_values_serial.py
